## 0.2.8 - August 3, 2011

* Replaced RSpec with Bacon.
* When retrieving section entries comments are now retrieved properly.
* Comments and categories are no longer retrieved by default when calling the
  section entries plugin.

* Plugins can be called as a singleton using Zen::Plugin.plugin.
* The column menu_items.order has been renamed to menu_items.sort_order.

  a Proc, this makes it possible for conditional possible values and such.

  better validation of various objects such as category groups when viewing a
  list of categories.

  the :method key.

  set correctly (issue #28).

  even more stable than ever.
* Fixed a few broken migrations.

## 0.2.7 - June 16, 2011

## 0.2.6.1 - June 1, 2011

  properly when using a multi-process based environment such as Unicorn.

## 0.2.6 - May 29, 2011

* Zen is now using RVM for gem management and such.

  Ramaze::Helper::Message.
* Dropped Zen::Database, Zen::Settings and most of the options in favor of
  instance variables set in the main Zen module. See commit
