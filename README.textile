h1. About

Zen is a modular CMS written on top of the awesome Ramaze framework.
Zen was built out of the frustration with Expression Engine, a popular CMS built on top of
the Codeigniter framework which in turn is written using PHP. While I really like Codeigniter,
ExpressionEngine and EllisLab there were several problems that bothered me.
So I set out to write a system that's loosely based on ExpressionEngine but fits my needs.
Because of this certain features may seem similar to those provided by EE and while at
certain points there are similarities there are also pretty big differences.
