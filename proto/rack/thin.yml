# Configuration file for Thin. Thin can be installed by running the following
# shell command:
#
#     $ gem install thin
#
# Once installed you can use the thin shell command to start/stop your
# application.

# Listen to 0.0.0.0:7000 by default.
port: 7000

# If you want to use a Unix socket instead uncomment the line below and make
# sure that the path points to a valid Unix socket.
#
# socket: 'path/to/socket'

# When set to true Thin will detach itself from the terminal and run as a
# daemon.

# Path to the PID file to use for each Thin worker.

# The user and group to use for each Thin process. It is recommended that you
# run your application using its own user and group.

# The amount of worker processes to start. It's very important to remember that
# setting this option above 1 requires you to use a Ramaze cache that stores
# it's data outside of each process' memory. An example of such a cache is
# Ramaze::Cache::MemCache. When doing so you should set the following caches:
#
# * Ramaze::Cache.options.session
# * Ramaze::Cache.options.settings
#
# Without this data will not be synced between Unicorn workers causing all kind
# of weird things to happen.
