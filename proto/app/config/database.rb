# It's recommended to create a separate database user for your Zen application
# and prevent it from being able to access other databases. Zen is new and may
# allow hackers to exploit the system.
#
# The following items can be set:
#
# * adapter: the adapter to use. When using MySQL it's best to use the mysql2
#   gem as it's a lot faster than the mysql gem.
# * host: the hostname where the database is located.
# * username: the username to use for connecting to the database.
# * password: the password to use for connecting to the database.
# * database: the name of the database to use.
# * test: whether or not the connection should be verified.
# * encoding: the encoding type to use.
# * logger: the logger used for logging queries and such.
#
# Fore more information see the Sequel documentation:
# http://sequel.rubyforge.org/rdoc/files/doc/opening_databases_rdoc.html
