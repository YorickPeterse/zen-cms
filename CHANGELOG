0.2.6 May 29 2011

* Zen is now using RVM for gem management and such.
* Began working on making Zen compatible with at least JRuby. Rubinius isn't worth the
effort at this time.
* Removed Ramaze::Helper::Common.notification in favor of Ramaze::Helper::Message.
* Dropped Zen::Database, Zen::Settings and most of the options in favor of instance
variables set in the main Zen module. See commit d40ee1c2e518a323b2983e1bcfb7a0d863bf3b2f
for more information.
* Translated Zen to Dutch.
* Re-organized the application prototypes to make them easier to use/understand.
* Implemented the anti-spam system as a plugin and added a decent XSS protection system
using Loofah.
* Various changes to the Javascript classes.
