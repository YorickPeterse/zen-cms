  ##
  # Zen::Package allows developers to register so called "packages". Packages
  # are collections of controllers, models, views and pretty much anything else
  # that goes in a typical Ramaze application. In fact, you can actually
  # distribute entire Ramaze applications as a package (though it would most
  # likely require some modifications).
  #
  # A package is registered by calling ``Zen::Package.add`` and passing a block
  # to it. This block will be yielded on a new instance of ``Zen::Package``:
  #
  #     Zen::Package.add do |p|
  #
  #     end
  #
  # When adding a package you must **always** set the following attributes:
  #
  # * name: the name of the package, should be a symbol
  # * title: the title of the package. This should be a language key such as
  #   "users.titles.index" as this allows users to view the package name in
  #   their chosen language.
  # * author: the name of the package's author.
  # * about: a description of the package, just like the title attribute this
  #   should be a language key, "users.description" is an example of such a key.
  # * root: the root directory of the package, this path should point to the
  #   directory containing your ``helper/`` and ``language/`` directories as
  #   well as any ``public/`` directories.
  #
  # Setting these (and other) attributes is very easy:
  #
  #     Zen::Package.add do |p|
  #       p.name   = :some_package
  #       p.title  = 'some_package.titles.index'
  #       p.author = 'John Doe'
  #       p.root   = __DIR__('some_package')
  #     end
  #
  # Besides the required attributes listed above you can also set the following
  # ones:
  #
  # * url: a URL that points to the website of the package.
  # * migrations: a directory containing all Sequel migrations.
  #
  # ## Package Structure
  #
  # Packages should have the same structure as generic Rubygems. In it's most
  # basic form this means you'll end up with a structure that looks like the
  # following:
  #
  #     root/
  #     |
  #     |__ lib/
  #        |__ package.rb
  #        |__ package/
  #           |__ controller/
  #           |__ helper/
  #
  # There's no requirement for the location of your migrations but it's
  # recommended to place it in the same directory as the ``lib/`` directory as
  # this is the convention followed by Zen itself.
  #
  # The advantage of this structure is that when a package is shipped via
  # Rubygems it can be loaded in exactly the same way as a normal gem. Say the
  # "some_package" example described earlier would be distributed via Rubygems,
  # all a developer would have to do to load the package is the following:
  #
  #     require 'some_package'
  #
  # It's not recommended to place packages or gems in the ``Zen`` namespace
  # unless they modify or add core features such as more validation methods for
  # ``Zen::Validation``.
  #
  # ## Menu Management
  #
  # Menus can be added by calling the method ``menu()`` on the object passed to
  # the block. This method takes a URL, a title/label and a hash of options.
  # Note that just like the ``name`` attribute the title/label should be a
  # language key.
  #
  #     Zen::Package.add do |p|
  #       p.menu('some_package.titles.index', '/admin/some-packages')
  #     end
  #
  # For more information see ``Zen::Package#menu()`` and ``Zen::Package::Menu``.
  #
  # ## Permissions
  #
  # When creating a package you can add a number of permissions. These
  # permissions can be assigned to a user or user group in the admin interface.
  # Permissions allow you to restrict access to certain actions to specific
  # users/user groups. A permission can be added by calling ``permission()`` on
  # the object passed to the block. Again the title of the permission should be
  # a langauge key so it can be displayed in a custom language:
  #
  #     Zen::Package.add do |p|
  #       p.permission(:show_some_package, 'packages.titles.index')
  #     end
  #
  # For more information on how to specify permission requirements in your
  # controllers see ``Ramaze::Helper::ACL``.
  #
  # ## Migrations
  #
  # Zen comes with two tasks that allow users and developers to update their
  # database, ``rake db:migrate`` and ``rake package:migrate``. For these tasks
  # to work there of course have to be migrations. When registering a package
  # you can set the ``migrations`` attribute. This attribute should contain a
  # path to a directory containing a group of timestamp based migrations such as
  # "1316770622_hello_world.rb".
  #
  # @since  0.1
  #
  class Package
    include Zen::Validation

    # names of all packages and the values the instances of Zen::Package::Base.
