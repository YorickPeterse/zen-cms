module Zen
  ##
  # Module used for registering extensions and themes, setting their details and
  # the whole shebang. Packages follow the same directory structure as Rubygems
  # and can actually be installed using either Rubygems or by storing them in a
  # custom directory. As long as you require the correct file you're good to go.
  #
  # Packages are added or "described" using a simple block and the add() method
  # as following:
  #
  #     Zen::Package.add do |ext|
  #       # ....
  #     end
  #
  # When using this block you're required to set the following attributes:
  #
  # * name: the name of the package in lowercased letters and/or numbers.
  # * author: the name of the person who made the package.
  # * about: a small description of the package.
  # * url: the URL to the package's website.
  # * directory: the root directory of the package, set this using
  #   __DIR__('path').
  #
  # Optionally you can also specify the attribute "menu" (more on that later).
  #
  # ## ACL
  #
  # Packages allow developers to register controllers for the ACL system that
  # ships with Zen. Doing this means a user can set controller specific rules
  # in the backend without having to write any code. In order to register a set
  # of controllers you'll need to set the "controllers" attribute in the package
  # block to a hash. The keys of this hash should be a human readable name of
  # the controller and the values the full namespace of the controller as either
  # a string or a constants:
  #
  #     Zen::Package.add do |pkg|
  #       pkg.controllers = {
  #         'Test Controller' => Test::Controller::TestController
  #       }
  #     end
  #
  # ## Menu Items
  #
  # The package system easily allows modules to add navigation/sub-navigation
  # elements to the backend menu. Each extension can have an attribute named
  # "menu", this attribute is an array of hashes. Each hash must have the
  # following 2 keys (they're symbols):
  #
  # * title: the value used for both the title tag and the text of the anchor
  #   element
  # * url: the URI the navigation item will point to. Leading slash isn't
  #   required
  #
  # Optionally you can specify child elements using the "children" key. This key
  # will again contain an array of hashes just like regular navigation elements.
  # For example, one could do the following:
  #
  #     ext.menu = [{:title => "Dashboard", :url => "admin/dashboard"}]
  #
  # Adding a number of child elements isn't very difficult either:
  #
  #     ext.menu = [{
  #       :title    => "Dashboard", :url => "admin/dashboard",
  #       :children => [{:title => "Child", :url => "admin/dashboard/child"}]
  #     }]
  #
  # Once a certain number of navigation elements have been added you can
  # generate the HTML for a fully fledged navigation menu using the
  # build_menu() method. This method uses Gestalt to build the HTML and also
  # takes care of permissions for each user/module.
  #
  # ## Migrations
  #
  # If your package uses it's own database tables it's best to use migrations as
  # these make it very easy to install/uninstall the extension. Migrations
  # should be put in the root directory of your extension. For example, if your
  # extension is in "foobar" the migrations should be located in
  # "foobar/migrations", the lib directory in "foobar/lib", etc.
  #
  # Migrations can be executed using the Thor task "package:migrate" or
  # "db:migrate", the latter will install all packages while the first one will
  # only install the specified packages. For more information on these tasks
  # execute the following command:
  #
  #     $ rake -T
