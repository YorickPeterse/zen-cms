module Zen
  ##
  # The language module is used for writing and using text translations.
  # Translations are stored in a simple YAML file inside a directory called
  # "language" followed by a directory who's name matches the language code for
  # which it's translations should be used. Say we wanted to translate "Login"
  # and "Register" into different languages our YAML file would look like the
  # following:
  #
  #     ---
  #     login: "Login"
  #     register: "Register"
  #
  # If we save this file under parent_directory/language/en/tutorial.yml we
  # could then load that file as following:
  #
  #     Zen::Language.load('tutorial')
  #
  # ## Loading Translations
  #
  # The load() method will look for a YAML file of which the name matches the
  # given string and can be found in the directory for the current language.
  # This means that if we were to switch our language without creating a
  # translation file for that language we wouldn't be able to use it
  # (makes sense right?).
  #
  # Once your translation file is in place and it's loaded it can be used using
  # the lang() method. Example:
  #
  #     lang('tutorial.login') # => "Login"
  #
  # ## Directory Structure
  #
  # As mentioned earlier language files are saved in a certain directory. The
  # structure of this directory looks like the following:
  #
  #     parent directory
  #       |
  #       |__ language
  #          |
  #          |__ language key (e.g. "en")
  #             |
  #             |__ filename.yml
  #
  # When loading a language file this module will loop through a certain number
  # of paths. The array containing all base directories to loop through can be
  # updated as following:
  #
  #     Zen::Language.options.paths.push('/path/to/directory')
  #
  # It's important that you _don't_ add a /language segment to the path, this
  # will be done automatically.
  #
  # ## Options
  #
  # * language: Small string that defines the current language (e.g. "en").
  # * paths: Array of paths to look for a language directory. Note that this
  #   should be the parent directory of the directory called "language", not the
  #   actual directory itself.

    # Method that takes a hash or an array and converts it to a dot-based hash.

    #       :location => {
    #         :street  => 'Street',

    #       'location.street'  => 'Street',

    #     out = to_dotted_hash(["Hello", "World"])

    # While it looks a bit goofy this allows you to do the following:

    #  self.to_dotted_hash({:name => "Yorick"}) # => {'name' => 'Yorick'}
