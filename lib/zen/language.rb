module Zen
  ##
  # The language module is used for writing and using text translations. 
  # Translations are stored in a simple YAML file inside a directory called 
  # "language" followed by a directory who's name matches the language code for 
  # which it's translations should be used. Say we wanted to translate "Login" 
  # and "Register" into different languages our YAML file would look like the 
  # following:
  #
  #     ---
  #     login: "Login"
  #     register: "Register"
  #
  # If we save this file under parent_directory/language/en/tutorial.yml we 
  # could then load that file as following:
  #
  #     Zen::Language.load('tutorial')
  #
  # ## Loading Translations
  #
  # The load() method will look for a YAML file of which the name matches the 
  # given string and can be found in the directory for the current language. 
  # This means that if we were to switch our language without creating a 
  # translation file for that language we wouldn't be able to use it 
  # (makes sense right?).
  #
  # Once your translation file is in place and it's loaded it can be used using 
  # the lang() method. Example:
  #
  #     lang('tutorial.login') # => "Login"
  #
  # ## Directory Structure
  #
  # As mentioned earlier language files are saved in a certain directory. The 
  # structure of this directory looks like the following:
  #
  #     parent directory
  #       |
  #       |__ language
  #          |
  #          |__ language key (e.g. "en")
  #             |
  #             |__ filename.yml
  #
  # When loading a language file this module will loop through a certain number 
  # of paths. The array containing all base directories to loop through can be 
  # updated as following:
  #
  #     Zen::Language.options.paths.push('/path/to/directory')
  #
  # It's important that you _don't_ add a /language segment to the path, this 
  # will be done automatically.
  #
  # ## Options
  #
  # * language: Small string that defines the current language (e.g. "en").
  # * paths: Array of paths to look for a language directory. Note that this 
  #   should be the parent directory of the directory called "language", not the 
  #   actual directory itself.

    # Method that takes a hash or an array and converts it to a dot-based hash. 
    # For example, the following hash:
    #
    #     {:name => 'Name', :location => {:street => 'Street', :address => 'Address'}}
    #
    # would result in the following:
    #
    #     {'name' => 'Name', 'location.street' => 'Street', 'location.address' => 'Address'}
    #
    # Using arrays would result in the following:
    #
    #     to_dotted_hash(["Hello", "World"]) # => {'1' => 'Hello', '2' => 'World'}
    #
    # While it looks a bit goofy this allows you to do the following:
    #
    #     lang('1') # => 'Hello'
    #
    # @example
    #  self.to_dotted_hash({:name => "Yorick"}) # => {'name' => 'Yorick'}
