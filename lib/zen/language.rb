module Zen
  ##
  # Zen comes with a system that allows developers to localize labels, field
  # names, and so on.  This can be extremely useful when you're developing a
  # package and want people to be able to use it even if they don't speak
  # English. Zen comes with a fairly easy to use language system that's based on
  # a collection of YAML files. Before you can use a language pack in your
  # package you'll have to make sure that the "language" directory exists in
  # your package directory. If so your structure should look something like the
  # following:
  #
  #     .
  #     |__ lib/
  #        |
  #        |__ my-package.rb
  #        |__ my-package/
  #           |
  #           |__ language/
  #
  # Inside the language directory there should be a directory who's name matches
  # the language key it represents. For example, a directory with translations
  # for English would be called "en". Language files for Dutch would be called
  # "nl" and so on. The name of the YAML files is also important and will be
  # used as the main key when retrieving language files. For example, if the
  # file is named "hello" it's content will be available under the hello
  # "namespace" (more on this later).
  #
  # As mentioned before language files are stored as YAML files. It doesn't
  # really matter what's in them but it's generally a good idea to format them
  # as following:
  #
  #     ---
  #     titles:
  #       index: 'Overview'
  #       edit:  'Edit Something'
  #
  # Retrieving language keys is done using the lang() method. This method takes
  # a single parameter, a string that specifies which key should be retrieved.
  # If we wanted to retrieve the key "edit" from the YAML file above you'd have
  # to do the following (assuming the YAML file is named "hello"):
  #
  #     lang('hello.titles.edit')
  #
  # As you can see sub-levels are specified using a dot between the levels. A
  # key B who's parent is A could be retrieved by doing ``lang('A.B')``.
  #
  # <div class="note todo">
  #     <p>
  #         <strong>Note</strong>: The lang() method is injected into the global
  #         namespace, you don't have to include a module in order to be able to
  #         use the method.
  #     </p>
  # </div>
  #
  # ## Loading Language Files
  #
  # In order to load a language file you'll need to do two things: add the
  # language directory to the available paths if this hasn't been done yet and
  # actually loading the file. The first can be done as following:
  #
  #     Zen::Language.options.paths.push('path/to/directory')
  #
  # This instructs the language system to look in the directory
  # ``path/to/directory`` for a directory named "language" containing all the
  # language files. Once this has been done you can load a language file using
  # ``Zen::Language.load``. The parameter of this method is the name of the YAML
  # file to load for the current language. Say there was a file
  # ``path/to/directory/language/en/test.yml``
  #
  # ## Example
  #
  # Let's assume we have a file located at
  # ``/home/yorickpeterse/foobar/language/en/foobar.yml`` with the following
  # content:
  #
  #     ---
  #     username: 'Username'
  #     location:
  #       street:  'Street'
  #       country: 'Country'
  #
  # We can load these keys as following:
  #
  #     Zen::Language.options.paths.push('/home/yorickpeterse/foobar/')
  #     Zen::Language.load('foobar')
  #
  #     lang('foobar.username')         # => "Username"
  #     lang('foobar.location.street')  # => "Street"
  #     lang('foobar.location.country') # => "Country"
  #
