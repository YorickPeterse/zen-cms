  class Plugin
    ##
    # The settings plugin is a plugin that can be used to register and migrate
    # settings without having to manually insert the data. Previously you'd have
    # to manually insert the data into the settings table at some point and the
    # process of loading translation keys and possible values was a pain. This
    # this plugin was created to solve most of those problems.
    #
    # ## Adding Settings
    #
    # In order to add a setting you'll first need to ensure there's at least a
    # single setting group available. These groups don't add any extra features
    # or whatsoever but are used to display settings in different tabs in the
    # backend interface. In order to register a new group you'd write the
    # following code:
    #
    #     plugin(:settings, :register_group) do |group|
    #       group.title = 'My Group'
    #       group.name  = 'my_group'
    #     end
    #
    # When registering a group you only need to specify a title and a name. The
    # name is used to associate a setting with it's group and thus should always
    # be unique. The title is displayed in the tab for the specific settings
    # group.
    #
    # Once a setting group has been added we can add a setting as following:
    #
    #     plugin(:settings, :register) do |setting|
    #       setting.title       = 'My Setting'
    #       setting.description = 'This is my setting!'
    #       setting.name        = 'my_setting'
    #       setting.group       = 'my_group'
    #       setting.type        = 'select'
    #       setting.values      = ['yorick', 'zen']
    #       setting.default     = 'yorick'
    #     end
    #
    # Note that the values array (or hash) is used to determine the possible
    # values for a field. These values will only be used for elements that only
    # allow a user to choose a single value (e.g. a checkbox). For the type
    # getter/setter you can use any of the following values:
    #
    # * textbox
    # * textarea
    # * radio
    # * checkbox
    # * date
    # * select
    # * select_multiple
    #
    # ## Migrating Settings
    #
    # Once a setting has been added you still have to migrate it. Zen takes care
    # of this so usually you don't need to manually migrate your settings. If
    # you do want to migrate them however you can simple execute the following
    # code:
    #
    #     plugin(:settings, :migrate)
    #
    # ## Removing Settings
    #
    # If you ever need to remove a setting both from the database and the system
    # you can do so as following:
    #
    #     plugin(:settings, :remove, ['name1', 'name2'])
    #
    # You don't have to specify an array of names, you can also specify the name
    # of a single setting to delete.
