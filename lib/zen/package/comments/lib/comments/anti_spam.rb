module Comments
  ##
  # {Comments::AntiSpam} is a module that can be used to verify if a comment is
  # spam or ham. In order to validate a comment you'll have to call
  # {Comments::AntiSpam.validate} and pass a set of parameters to it (see the
  # documentation of {Comments::AntiSpam.validate} for more information). An
  # example of validating a comment using Defensio looks like the following:
  #
  #     spam = Comments::AntiSpam.validate(
  #       :defensio,
  #       nil,
  #       nil,
  #       nil,
  #       'This is a comment that has to be validated'
  #     )
  #
  # ## Supported Systems
  #
  # By default only Defensio is supported.
  #
  # ## Adding Systems
  #
  # Adding a new anti spam system is done in two steps. First you must add the
  # name of the method to {Comments::AntiSpam::Registered} (the method should be
  # a symbol). This constant is a hash of which the keys are the method names of
  # the engines to invoke and the values the labels to display in the admin
  # panel. Without this the {Comments::AntiSpam.validate} method will raise an
  # error. This check is put in place to ensure that the user can't potentially
  # exploit the system.
  #
  # Once the method has been added to the list you must actually implement it as
  # a class method. The syntax of such a method looks like the following:
  #
  #     def self.method_name(author, email, url, comment)
  #
  #     end
  #
  # The return value should be a boolean that indicates whether or not the
  # comment is spam. A return value of ``true`` indicates that the comment is
  # spam, anything that evaluates to ``false`` indicates that the comment is
  # valid.
  #
  # In order to add your method you simply add it like you normally would with
  # any other class:
  #
  #     module Comments
  #       module AntiSpam
  #         private
  #
  #         def self.custom_method(author, email, url, comment)
  #
  #         end
  #       end
  #     end

    }

      # Validates a comment to see if it's spam or ham using a given engine.
      # Defensio only validates the comment itself.
      #

      #    'chuck@chucknorris.com',
      #    'http://chucknorris.com/',

      # @author Yorick Peterse
      # @since  0.2.9
      # @param  [#to_sym] engine The name of the anti spam engine to use.
      # @param  [String] author The name of the author of the comment.
      # @param  [String] email The Email address of the author.
      # @param  [String] url The URL that points to the user's website
      #  (optional).
      # @param  [String] comment The comment to validate.
      # @return [TrueClass|FalseClass]
      #
