  module Controller
    ##
    # Controller for managing existing comments. When logged in a user can not
    # add a comment, for that they'd have to use the frontend.
    #
    # Depending on the settings of a section the comments belong to (via a
    # section entry) users may have to meet certain requirements in order to be
    # able to post a comment. For example, a section might require users to be
    # logged in in order to post comments. If this is the case and the user
    # tries to submit a comment a message will be displayed and the HTTP status
    # code is changed to 403. See {Comments::Controller::CommentsForm} for more
    # information.
    #
    # In order to manage existing comments you'll have to navigate to
    # ``/admin/comments``. This page will show an overview of all existing
    # comments (or a message if no comments were found).
    #
    # ![Comments](../../_static/comments/comments.png)
    #
    # Comments can be edited by clicking on their name. Deleting comments can be
    # done by checking the checkboxes in each row followed by clicking the
    # "Delete selected comments" button.
    #
    # ## Editing Comments
    #
    # ![Edit Comment](../../_static/comments/edit_comment.png)
    #
    # When editing a comment you can specify/update the following fields:
    #
    # * **Name**: the name of the author. This field can only be changed if the
    #   comment was posted by somebody that wasn't logged in.
    # * **Website**: the website of the author that posted the comment.
    # * **Email**: the Email address of the author. If the comment was posted by
    #   a user that wasn't logged in then this field is required.
    # * **Status**: the status of a comment, can be "Open", "Closed" or "Spam".
    #   If the status is something other than "Open" it will be hidden when the
    #   comments plugin is used.
    # * **Comment** (required): the actual comment. Based on a section's
    #   settings these are formatted using Markdown, Textile or any of the other
    #   available markup processors.
    #
    # Note that if a comment was posted by a user that was logged in you won't
    # be able to change the name of the author.
    #
    # ## Used Permissions
    #
    # This controller uses the following permissions:
    #
    # * show_comment
    # * edit_comment
    # * new_comment
    # * delete_comment
    #
    # ## Events
    #
    # All events called in this controller receive an instance of
    # {Comments::Model::Comment}. However, just like all other controllers the
    # ``delete_comment`` receives an instance of this model that has already
    # been destroyed.
    #
    # An example of using one of these events is to notify a user when his
    # comment has been marked as spam:
    #
    #     require 'mail'
    #
    #     Zen::Event.call(:after_edit_comment) do |comment|
    #       email = comment.user.email
    #       spam  = Comments::Model::CommentStatus[:name => 'spam']
    #
    #       if comment.comment_status_id == spam.id
    #         Mail.deliver do
    #           from    'example@domain.tld'
    #           to      email
    #           subject 'Your comment has been marked as spam'
    #           body    "Dear #{comment.user.name}, your comment has been " \
    #             "marked as spam"
    #        end
    #      end
    #    end
