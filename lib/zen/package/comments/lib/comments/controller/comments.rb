    ##
    # Controller for managing existing comments. When logged in a user can not
    # add a comment, for that they'd have to use the frontend.
    #
    # Depending on the settings of a section the comments belong to (via a
    # section entry) users may have to meet certain requirements in order to be
    # able to post a comment. For example, a section might require users to be
    # logged in in order to post comments. If this is the case and the user
    # tries to submit a comment a message will be displayed and the HTTP status
    # code is changed to 403. See {Comments::Controller::CommentsForm} for more
    # information.
    #
    # In order to manage existing comments you'll have to navigate to
    # ``/admin/comments``. This page will show an overview of all existing
    # comments (or a message if no comments were found).
    #
    # ![Comments](../../images/comments/comments.png)
    #
    # Comments can be edited by clicking on their name. Deleting comments can be
    # done by checking the checkboxes in each row followed by clicking the
    # "Delete selected comments" button.
    #
    # ## Editing Comments
    #
    # ![Edit Comment](../../images/comments/edit_comment.png)
    #
    # When editing a comment you can specify/update the following fields:
    #
    # <table class="table full">
    #     <thead>
    #         <tr>
    #             <th>Field</th>
    #             <th>Required</th>
    #             <th>Maximum Length</th>
    #             <th>Description</th>
    #         </tr>
    #     </thead>
    #     <tbody>
    #         <tr>
    #             <td>Name</td>
    #             <td>
    #                 Only when the comment was submitted by a non logged in
    #                 user.
    #             </td>
    #             <td>255</td>
    #             <td>
    #                 The name of the author of the comment. This field can only
    #                 be edited if the comment was submitted by a user that
    #                 wasn't logged in.
    #             </td>
    #         </tr>
    #         <tr>
    #             <td>Website</td>
    #             <td>No</td>
    #             <td>255</td>
    #             <td>The website of the comment author.</td>
    #         </tr>
    #         <tr>
    #             <td>Email</td>
    #             <td>
    #                 Only if the comment was submitted by a user that wasn't
    #                 logged in.
    #             </td>
    #             <td>255</td>
    #             <td>
    #                 The Email address of the comment author. Like the name
    #                 field this field can only be edited if the comment was
    #                 submitted by a user that wasn't logged in.
    #             </td>
    #         </tr>
    #         <tr>
    #             <td>Status</td>
    #             <td>No</td>
    #             <td></td>
    #             <td>
    #                 The status of the comment. If a comment is created and no
    #                 status is specified the status will be set to "closed".
    #             </td>
    #         </tr>
    #         <tr>
    #             <td>Comment</td>
    #             <td>Yes</td>
    #             <td>Unlimited</td>
    #             <td>The actual comment.</td>
