    ##
    # A plugin that can be used to verify a comment against an external (or
    # internal) service to see if it's spam or ham.
    #
    # ## Usage
    #
    #     plugin(:anti_spam, engine, author, email, url, comment)
    #
    # Note that all variables are required. This is because certain anti-spam
    # systems may verify the name of the author or the entered Email address
    # besides just the comment. When using Defensio you're only required to set
    # the comment:
    #
    #     plugin(
    #       :anti_spam, :defensio, nil, nil, nil, 'Hello, this is a comment.'
    #     )
    #
    # ## Supported Systems
    #
    # Currently the plugin only supports Defensio, this engine requires the
    # setting "defensio_key" to contain a valid Defensio API key.
    #
    # ## Adding Systems
    #
    # Adding a system is done in two steps. First you should update the hash
    # Comments::PLugin::AntiSpam::Registered so that it includes your system.
    # The keys of this hash are symbols that match the name of the engine used
    # when calling the plugin() method. The values are the Gems to require.
    #
    # Once this has been done you should add a method to the class
    # Comments::Plugin::AntiSpam who's name matches the key set in the
    # Registered hash. If your anti-spam solution is called "cake" then you'd
    # do something like the following:
    #
    #     Comments::Plugin::AntiSpam::Registered[:cake] = 'cake-gem'
    #
    #     module Comments
    #       module Plugin
    #         class AntiSpam
    #           def cake
    #
    #           end
    #         end
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # The return value of the method added should be a boolean, true for spam
    # and false for ham.
