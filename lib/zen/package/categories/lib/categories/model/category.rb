  module Model
    ##
    # Model that represents a single category. This model has the following relations:
    #
    # * category groups (one to one)
    # * self (many to one)
    #
    # This model uses the following plugins:
    #
    # * sluggable (source: "name")
    #
    # When creating or saving a category the fields "name" and "slug" are required.
    # The latter is only needed when saving an existing category as a slug will be
    # generated whenever the field is empty. It's also important to remember
    # that slugs have to be unique. For more info see the validate() method.
