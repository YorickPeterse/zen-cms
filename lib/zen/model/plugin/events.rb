module Sequel
  module Plugins
    ##
    # Plugin for Sequel that acts as a bridge between Sequel hooks and events
    # fired by {Zen::Event}. Based on the specified options it creates events
    # for the following Sequel hooks:
    #
    # * before_create
    # * after_create
    # * before_update
    # * after_update
    # * before_destroy
    # * after_destroy
    #
    # For example, to add the Zen event "before_new_post" and have it called by
    # the Sequel hook "before_create" you'd do the following:
    #
    #  class Posts < Sequel::Model
    #    plugin :events, :before_create => :before_new_post
    #  end
    #
    # Each event will receive an instance of the model. This means that you're
    # free to modify the model in your events as long as you take into account
    # that other events might do the same:
    #
    #     Zen::Event.listen(:before_new_post) do |post|
    #       post.title = 'a'
    #     end
    #
    # Events don't have to return the modified object as objects are assigned by
    # reference.
