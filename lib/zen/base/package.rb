module Zen
  ##
  # Module used for registering extensions and themes, setting their details and the 
  # whole shebang. Packages follow the same directory structure as Rubygems and can 
  # actually be installed using either Rubygems or by storing them in a custom directory. 
  # As long as you require the correct file you're good to go.
  #
  # Packages are added or "described" using a simple block and the add() method as following:
  #
  #     Zen::Package.add do |ext|
  #       # ....
  #     end
  #
  # When using this block you're required to set the following attributes:
  #
  # * type: the type of package, can either be "theme" or "extension"
  # * name: the name of the package
  # * author: the name of the person who made the package
  # * version: the current version, either a string or a numeric value
  # * about: a small description of the package
  # * url: the URL to the package's website
  # * identifier: unique identifier for the package. The format is com.AUTHOR.NAME for
  # extensions and com.AUTHOR.themes.NAME for themes.
  # * directory: the root directory of the package, set this using __DIR__('path')
  # 
  # Optionally you can also specify the attribute "menu" (more on that later).
  #
  # ## Menu Items
  #
  # The package system easily allows modules to add navigation/sub-navigation elements
  # to the backend menu. Each extension can have an attribute named "menu", this attribute
  # is an array of hashes. Each hash must have the following 2 keys (they're symbols):
  #
  # * title: the value used for both the title tag and the text of the anchor element
  # * url: the URI the navigation item will point to. Leading slash isn't required
  #
  # Optionally you can specify child elements using the "children" key. This key
  # will again contain an array of hashes just like regular navigation elements.
  # For example, one could do the following:
  #
  #     ext.menu = [{:title => "Dashboard", :url => "admin/dashboard"}]
  #
  # Adding a number of child elements isn't very difficult either:
  #
  #     ext.menu = [{
  #       :title    => "Dashboard", :url => "admin/dashboard",
  #       :children => [{:title => "Child", :url => "admin/dashboard/child"}]
  #     }]
  #
  # Once a certain number of navigation elements have been added you can generate the
  # HTML for a fully fledged navigation menu using the build_menu() method. This method
  # uses Gestalt to build the HTML and also takes care of permissions for each user/module.
  #
  # ## Migrations
  #
  # If your package uses it's own database tables it's best to use migrations as these make
  # it very easy to install/uninstall the extension. Migrations should be put in the root
  # directory of your extension. For example, if your extension is in "foobar" the migrations
  # should be located in "foobar/migrations", the lib directory in "foobar/lib", etc.
  #
  # Migrations can be executed using the Rake task "extension:migrate" or "db:migrate",
  # the latter will install all extensions while the first one will only install the 
  # specified extension. Migration prototypes can be generated by the Rake task
  # "proto:migration[DIRECTORY]" where DIRECTORY is the path to your migrations directory.
  #
  # ## Themes
  #
  # Themes are essentially packages like the sections or comments module except that they
  # have a few limitations and work a bit different. First of all themes can't add 
  # navigation items to the backend and second they should _always_ have the following 
  # directories:
  #
  # * theme/lib/theme/templates
  # * theme/lib/theme/public
  #
  # The templates directory is used to store all Liquid templates and template groups, 
  # the public directory is used for CSS files, images and so on. Themes can have 
  # migrations just like extensions which makes it relatively easy to share a theme 
  # with somebody else.
