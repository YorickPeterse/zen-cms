module Zen
  ##
  # The database module is one of the most important classes in Zen (which is quite obvious).
  # Without this module the application wouldn't exist. The database module is basically a small
  # wrapper around the Sequel.connect method and allows developers to specify database
  # settings for various environments (live, test, production, etc) using a simple block.
  #
  # h2. Database Configuration
  #
  # Connecting to a database is fairly easy and only requires a single configuration file.
  # In this file, called "database.rb" you'll define all your database environments (live, dev, test, etc).
  # 
  # bc.. Zen::Database.mode :dev do |db|
  #   db.adapter  = 'mysql'
  #   db.host     = 'localhost'
  #
  #   db.username = 'root'
  #   db.password = 'root'
  #   db.database = 'database'
  # end
  #
  # p. In this example we're connecting to "localhost" using the mysql adapter and selecting the database
  # called "database". When placing multiple environments in the same file you don't have to worry about 
  # them overriding eachother, Zen will only load the environment settings of the block that matches
  # the current environment set in Ramaze.options.mode.
  #
  # h2. Database Interaction
  #
  # Once your database configuration file has been loaded you can communicate with the database using 
  # models. Each model should extend the base model provided by Sequel:
  #
  # bc. class Comment < Sequel::Model
  # end
  #
  # Models can be called like any other class and don't need to be initialized. For more information
  # on how to use models using Sequel you should read Sequel's documentation: http://sequel.rubyforge.com/

    # Initializes a new database connection based on the configuration options specified in
    # Zen::Database.options. Sequel will trigger an error in case any of these settings
    # are incorrect. For logging a custom logger will be used, this logger can be found in
    # Zen::Logger().
    #
    # An extra notice for MySQL users, Zen uses InnoDB in order to use true foreign keys.
    # Make sure that your MySQL installation comes with the InnoDB plugin.

    # directly using Zen.options.db.
