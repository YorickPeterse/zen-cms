  ##
  # Themes in many ways are similar to plugins and packages but with a few differences.
  # Unlike packages themes aren't able to update the entire Ramaze root, this prevents
  # them from loading controllers and other classes unless the developer updates these
  # paths manually. However, themes can set the following paths:
  #
  # * template_dir: the directory where all Liquid templates are located, always required.
  # * partial_dir: the directory where all Liquid partials are located.
  # * public_dir: the public directory containing assets such as CSS and Javascript files.
  # * migration_dir: themes can use migrations to automatically add the required fields to
  # the database, this setting should point to the directory where all migrations are
  # located.
  #
  # ## Adding Themes
  #
  # Just like plugins and packages a theme can be added by calling Zen::Theme#add and
  # passing a block to it. Once a theme has been loaded it will *not* be used until the
  # user sets it as the active theme in the settings module.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #     Zen::Theme.add do |theme|
  #       theme.author     = 'Yorick Peterse'
  #       theme.name       = 'Default'
  #       theme.identifier = 'com.yorickpeterse.theme.default'
  #     end
  #
  # The "identifier" key is very important and just like packages and plugins it should
  # always stay the same once it has been set.
  #
  # ## Identifiers
  #
  # Theme identifiers should be in the following format:
  #
  #     com.VENDOR.theme.NAME
  #
  # For example:
  #
  #     com.yorickpeterse.theme.fancy_blog
  #
  # @author Yorick Peterse
  # @since  0.2.4
  # @attr_reader [Array] themes Array of all installed themes.
  #
  module Theme
    class << self
      attr_reader :themes
    end

    ##
    # Adds a new theme to Zen. Note that the theme won't be used unless it has been set
    # as the active theme in the settings package.
    #
    # @author Yorick Peterse
    # @since  0.2.4
    # @yield  [theme] Struct object containing all getter/setters for each theme.
