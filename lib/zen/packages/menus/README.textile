h1. About

The Menus extension can be used to create navigation menus for the frontend of your website.
Each menu item can have an infinite number of sub items which in turn can contain sub items
as well. Once you have created your menus you can display them using the "menus" tag:

bc. {% menu slug="main" %}

The output of the menus tag can not be changed but then again it's a simple unordered list
with a class of "menu" and an ID of "menu_SLUG". An example of this output would look
like the following:

bc. <ul class="menu" id="menu_main">
  <li>
    <a href="http://zen-cms.com/">Zen CMS</a>
  </li>
</ul>

h2. Installation

Require the package in your config/requires.rb file and run the migrations:

bc. $ rake extension:migrate

Once that's done you can start adding menu items in the backend. This extension can be
found at /admin/menus.
