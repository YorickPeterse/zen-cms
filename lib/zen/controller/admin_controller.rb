    ##
    # The admin controller is a base controller that should be extended by all controllers
    # for the backend of Zen. This controller will automatically check to see if the user is
    # logged in and perform several other tasks such as loading all Javascript and CSS stylesheet
    # along with our helpers and so on.
    #
    # h2. Authentication
    #
    # It's important to remember that any controller that extends this one will require the
    # user to be logged in. The only exception for this is the login method for the Users
    # controller, mapped to /admin/users/login. If a user isn't logged in he/she will be redirected
    # to the login page.
    #
    # h2. Helpers
    #
    # The admin controller loads the following helpers:
    #
    # * CSRF
    # * BlueForm
    # * Common
    # * Breadcrumb
    # * User
    # * ACL
    # * Asset
