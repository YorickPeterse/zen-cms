## 0.4.2 - April 16th, 2012

* Bugfix for rendering menu items in the backend. Due to a typo the menu items
  in the backend would only be displayed if a user was a super user. Because
  this is a rather annoying issue I decided to push another release.

## 0.4.1 - April 16th, 2012

* Updated various version requirements.
* Menu items are sorted properly, in some cases the sort order would be broken
  due to the dataset being sorted after it was retrieved.
* Replaced RDiscount with Redcarpet.
* Show menu items without permissions.
* Documentation improvements and fixed various spelling errors.
* Removed the `post_start` event.
* Load core packages when connecting to a DB.
* Call `:post_start` before building assets.
* Hide messages by clicking on them.
* Basic set of styles for the pagination buttons.
* Preserve author IDs for section entries
* Handle forms using the Mootools class Zen.Form.
* Moved Mootools events into their own file.
* Set Ramaze.options.mode before Zen.root.

## 0.4 - March 7th, 2012

* Packages can contain multiple menus.
* New UI for the backend.
* All Javascript code is executed in strict mode.
* Added a new Javascript class for parsing hash fragments: Zen.Hash.
* Active tabs "persist" by changing URL hash fragments.
* Slugs are generated less aggressively, allowing the use of characters such as
  hyphens.
* Various documentation improvements and numerous bug fixes.
* Datepickers can be customized using HTML attributes.
* Etanni template tags are escaped when dealing with user input.
* Added a new package: "Dashboard". This package shows various widgets and
  replaces the "Sections" package as the landing page after logging in.
* Performance improvements for ``Ramaze::Helper::MenuFrontend#render_menu()``.
  These improvements mean that only two queries are needed to retrieve a menu
  and build the hierarchy of menu items (regardless of the amount).
* Fixed an issue that would incorrectly generate application names when creating
  a new application using ``zen create``.
* Full stack traces are logged in case of errors rather than just the message.
* Model related events (e.g. `before_new_section_entry`) have been moved into
  their corresponding models.
* Menu item manager has been re-written so that menu items can be organized
  using a drop and drag interface.
* The various assets used by Zen have been re-organized.
* Custom data can be stored in themes and packages in the ``env`` attribute.
* Forms are automatically saved every 10 minutes. This only happens for forms
  that contain data of existing objects.
* The controller Zen::Controller::Translations has been removed. Instead of
  using a controller translations are simply dumped as a JSON string in a view.
* Fixed an issue that would cause Zen to crash when trying to store certain data
  using Ramaze::Cache::LRU.
* Custom fields are re-filled with their values whenever a user tries to
  save/create a section entry with invalid/missing data.
* CSRF errors no longer show a plain text message but instead redirect users
  back to the previous page. In case of such an error forms will be re-filled to
  prevent data loss.
* The sort order of menu items increments automatically unless a custom order
  has been specified.
* Various dependencies have been updated.

  status.

  even more stable than ever.
* Fixed a few broken migrations.

  properly when using a multi-process based environment such as Unicorn.
