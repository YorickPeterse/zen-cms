# README

Zen is a modular CMS written on top of the awesome Ramaze framework. Zen was
built out of the frustration with Expression Engine, a popular CMS built on top
of the Codeigniter framework which in turn is written using PHP. While I really
like Codeigniter, ExpressionEngine and EllisLab there were several problems
that bothered me. So I set out to write a system that's loosely based on
ExpressionEngine but fits my needs. Because of this certain features may seem
similar to those provided by EE and while at certain points there are
similarities there are also pretty big differences.

## Requirements

* Ramaze 2011.01.30 or newer
* Ruby 1.9.2
* A database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc)

## Installation

Installing Zen using Rubygems is probably the easiest way:

    $ gem install zen
    $ zen create application_name

If you like to hack with the core of Zen it's best to install it using Git:

    $ git clone git://github.com/zen-cms/Zen-Core.git
    $ cd zen-core
    $ rake build:gem

## Database Support

Technically Zen should run on any given DBMS that's supported by Sequel as Zen
doesn't use any DBMS specific field types. However, there might be a chance that
it won't work. If you happen to have any problems getting Zen running using your
database of choice feel free to submit a ticket or post it on the mailing
list.

The Zen website itself is tested and served using MySQL, SQLite3 works just as
fine and PostgreSQL will be tested in the near future.

## Running Zen

Zen can be run using any webserver as long as it supports Rack. Thin, Unicorn or
Passenger, they should all work. The main website of Zen is served using Unicorn
and Nginx, development is done using WEBRick and Unicorn.

## Documentation

The documentation (both the userguide and the API docs) can be found on the
website, located [here][zen documentation].

## Hacking/Contributing

Zen follows a relatively strict set of guidelines when it comes to developing
core features and making sure everything goes along smoothly. When working with
Git a branch model based on [nvie's branch model][nvie branch model] is used.
This means that the "master" branch is directly used for pushing Gems and thus
should *always* contain stable code. Develop is used to contain less stable (but
not unstable) commits that will be pushed into "master" from time to time.  All
other branches, e.g. "rspec2" will be used for individual features.

Besides following this model developers are also expected to write tests using
either RSpec or Capybara for their features. Capybara is used to test
controllers and browser based tests while RSpec is used to test libraries,
helpers, etc.

## Coding Standards

* 2 spaces per indentation level for Ruby code.
* 4 spaces per indentation level for Javascript, CSS and HTML.
* Document your code, that includes CSS and Javascript files.
* No tabs at all times.
* Markdown is used for all markup.
* The maximum width of each line should be no more than 80 characters, this
  makes it easier to read code in terminals or when using split view modes. The
  limit used to be 90 characters but this was decreased to fit the Ruby coding
  standards. Existing code using the 90 character limit will be changed over
  time.

## Community

* [Website][zen website]
* [Mailing list][mailing list]

Zen does not have it's own IRC channel at this time but you can usually find me
in any of the following channels on Freenode:

* \#forrst-chat
* \#ramaze
* \#codeigniter
* \#mootools
