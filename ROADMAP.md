Please note that the release dates in this roadmap may and most likely will change from
time to time. List items that contain a "(!)" are considered to be important and should
be solved/added before any of the other items. Items containing "(?)" are considered
to be unverified/undecided and might not be added/completed at all.

## Planned Releases

### 0.3 - June 2011

* Most parts of the core covered by specs. (!)
* A working (although probably rough) plugin system to extend the inner parts of Zen. 
An example of a plugin would be something that allows the use of Akismet for comments
rather than Defensio.
* Website completely up and running. (!)
* Translation system for the Javascript used in the backend
* Documentation/Userguide online

### 0.2 - March 2011

* General code improvements.
* Navigation module for the frontend.
* Improved Liquid tags.
* A working datepicker
* Refilling forms in case of errors (!)

### 0.1a - February 2011

The first public alpha released, mainly meant to give people and idea of what Zen is 
all about.
